 For a more in depth view of what LSI is, and how to integrate it into your distribution,
-please check the [technical README document](https://github.com/solus-project/linux-steam-integration/blob/master/TECHNICAL.md).
-
-Be advised that we intend to remove the need for distributions to integrate LSI in the near future, by providing
-the LSI system as a [snap](https://snapcraft.io/) package for all supported distributions.
-
-## Getting LSI
-
-LSI may not yet be available for your distribution, however some community maintained repositories do exist.
-
- - [Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-steam-integration/)
- - [Fedora](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/alunux/linux-steam-integration/)
- - Solus uses LSI by default, just install the `steam` package.
-
-To install the experimental snaps (`snapd` >= 2.29.4):
-
-    sudo snap install --edge solus-runtime-gaming
-    sudo snap install --devmode --edge linux-steam-integration
-
-## Snap Support
-
-LSI is currently undergoing work to become a universal package for all Linux distributions!
-
-Items left to implement:
-
- - [x] Add basic library support for snapd environment
- - [x] Make `shim` support `$SNAP` style environmental variables for local Steam
- - [x] Add support to LSI + `snapd` for NVIDIA+Vulkan
- - [ ] Verify "normal" games work again
- - [x] Publish snaps (edge)

@@ -270,13 +270,7 @@ If you are noticing performance regressions, you can:
  - As a packager: Disable `liblsi-intercept` via build flags. This will hurt compatibility.
  - As a distribution integrator: Add weight to upstream issue and import patch into your distribution.
    This will retain LSI compatibility magic and mitigate performance issues.
-   As an example, Solus has already [integrated the patch](https://dev.solus-project.com/R927:afa5b639e8a9b62618457a304d1e6fb42a9f2066).
-
-The long term solution is to remove this burden from non-Solus Linux distributions, and for the Solus & LSI projects to
-provide a specialised runtime & strict LSI build via third party mechanisms so that all this work only needs doing once.
-This will help ensure the same gaming experience regardless of Linux distribution, remove all compatibility issues, and
-any pressures on distributions. Additionally this will allow even distributions not supporting multilib to provide a
-curated and well integrated gaming runtime.
